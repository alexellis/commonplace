Uncertain if this is a keeper, there's potentially a lot of variations.

Fry onions in a saucepan.
Add canned diced or crushed tomatoes.
Stir in a few heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter.
Season with hot sauce.
Cook until done.

Serving suggestion: wilted spinach, sweet potato fries, hard boiled eggs.
