title: Frittata
---
Good for using up vegetables.

Saute green onions or garlic in a big frying pan. Add cooked
vegetables (asparagus e.g. or chard) or fresh green (e.g. spinach).

Pour in six or seven beaten eggs. If you have the time, separate
out the eggs and beat the whites for a fluffier frittata.

I'm told that the secret ingredient for the Morgan and York frittata
is crumbled potato chips, left to soak up the egg mixture.

Top with parsley, sun-dried tomatoes, olives.

Cook over medium heat (6 or 7) until done; cover at the end to get
the top fully set. Sprinkle grated cheese over the top near the end
of cooking, it will melt from the hot frittata. If desired, put the
pan under a broiler at the end to toast the cheese.
