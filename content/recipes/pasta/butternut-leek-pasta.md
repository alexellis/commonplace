title: Butternut leek pasta
---
Roast a butternut squash. Cut it in half
lengthwise and bake at 400 degres for about
an hour. Scoop out the seeds at the end.

Wash three leeks, carefully. Chop small and
saute in olive oil with some thyme. Set aside.

Boil some pasta (like farfalle) according to
package directions, set aside.

When the squash is ready, let it cool a bit then
cut it into cubes. Mix the leeks, pasta, and squash
together. Add a few tablespoons of milk or cream,
then heat to warm through.

Serve with asparagus or some other green vegetable
in season.
