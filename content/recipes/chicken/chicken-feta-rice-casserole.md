title: Chicken feta rice casserole
---
* Rice
* Chicken
* Basil, fried in olive oil
* Sun dried tomatoes
* Kalamata olives, chopped
* Feta cheese crumbles
* 1 cup Chicken broth

Cook the rice. Cut the chicken small and brown it, perhaps with
some garlic or onion. Fry up the basil in a little olive oil.

Get a big casserole dish. Mix the cooked rice, cooked chicken,
cheese, and other ingredients. Add 1c chicken broth. Bake at 350
covered for what, about 20 minutes? Then take the top off and cook
for 10 more?  Something like that, it's pretty forgiving.

Next time add cooked greens.
