title: Chicken curry Kasoa
---
A chicken coconut curry rice casserole, with ingredients
from Kasoa (African market at Ellsworth and Platt).

* Green onions from last week
* Olive oil
* 2 lbs of chicken, frozen, cubed in 1" cubes. Enough to fit in a big pan.
* Broth made from cubes
* Rice, cooked (2 measures)
* Curry powder
* Can of coconut cream
* Parsley, cut small.

Brown the onions in the oil. Brown the frozen cubed chicken. Add 2
cups of broth, turn the heat down, simmer for a good long while,
adding more liquid as necessary. Depending on your chicken this
might be fast or slow.

Cook the rice.

When the chicken falls off the bone, separate it from the bones,
being sure not to leave any bones behind! This is difficult but
important.

Mix everything together and bake at 375 until bubbly.

Warn everyone that there might be bones, eat carefully.
