Zucchini Feta Pancakes (“Moosewood Cookbook” Mollie Katzen)

One usually thinks of a pancake supper as a generally starchy affair.
However, the bulk of these lovely pancakes consists of eggs and
zucchini with just enough flour to bind them. This makes enough to
comfortably fill four average sized persons.  About 30 minutes to
prepare, before frying.

* 4 packed cups coarsely grated zucchini
* 4 eggs, separated
* 1 heaping cup finely crumbled feta cheese
* ½ cup minced scallions
* ¾ tsp dried mint
* salt and black pepper
* 1/3 cup flour
* butter for frying (olive oil)
* sour cream or yogurt for topping

Place the grated zucchini in a colander in a bowl, salt it lightly
and let it stand 15 minutes. Rinse it, and squeeze out all excess
water.

Combine squeezed zucchini, egg yolks, feta, scallions, flour, and spices. Mix well.

Beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Fold into first mixture.

Fry in butter, on both sides, until golden and crisp, about 8 minutes per side.

Serve topped with sour cream or yogurt.
