> All procrastinators put off things they have to do. 
Structured procrastination is the art of making this bad trait work for you. 
> One needs to be able to recognize and commit oneself to tasks with 
inflated importance and unreal deadlines, while making oneself feel 
that they are important and urgent. This clears the way to accomplish 
several apparently less urgent, but eminently achievable, tasks.
